                        <p>I have been programming since I was 14, but it was only during my time studying Computer Science in high school that I discovered my <b className="text-tertiary">passion for web development</b> and felt a deep connection to it. Since then, I have been dedicated to creating websites and refining my skills in <b>front-end development</b>.</p>

                        <p>My journey started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I soon adopted React as my first framework, but <b className="text-tertiary">Next.js</b> became my forte. I excel in creating dynamic, fast web apps with it. Alongside, I&apos;ve used Bootstrap, but I prefer <b className="text-tertiary">Tailwind CSS</b> for its utility-first approach. It enhances my workflow, letting me focus on intuitive UI design.</p>

                            Since <b>LLMs</b> became publicly available, my fascination with artificial intelligence has grown immensely.

                            Outside of work, I immerse myself in enriching hobbies. Music is a deep passionâ€”I play multiple instruments and explore diverse genres. I also collect rare records that resonate with me. In gaming, I combine technical skills with storytelling to create immersive experiences. These activities fuel my creativity, offering balance and fresh perspectives.
